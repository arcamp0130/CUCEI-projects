**👋 Hello there!**

Feel free to check every part of these projects.

## 📖 Let's get started
This repository was created with the special purpose of upload and update every single project created by CUCEI professors in order to get multiple skills in programming.

Therefore, you, my guest, will find a lot of small example programs, solving every kind of problems to develop critical thinking, mathematical logic and gain capability to break down complex problem in several simple and modular steps to achieve a goal.

### 🔍 This you're going to find
Because this repository may have several languages, follow this structure to know how to navigate through the directories:

``` file tree
CUCEI-projects/
├── C/
│   ├── calculator/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── guess number/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── invetory/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── modularization/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── numeric-pattern/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── operator types/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── tic-tac-toe/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── variables and constants/
│       └── ...
├── .gitignore
└── readme.md
```

Inside every folder, you will find several files (`.c`, `.h`) with important source code to compile and execute every single program inside.

## ⚙️ Used tools
Since this repo is planned to have several languages, here you can find which tools and more are used to code, test and run every source file.

> [!NOTE]
> Along time, this list is going to grow. <br>

### Hunt the Wumpus
[![Hunt the Wumpus - Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hunt_the_wumpus-Under_development-834e16?logo=github&logoColor=white&labelColor=22212C)](https://github.com/arcamp0130/CUCEI-projects/tree/main/C) <br>
This is a recreation of the "Hunt the Wumpus" game, that consists of hunting a creature known as *The Wumpus*. You only got a chance to hit and hunt it; if you fail, *the wumpus* hunts you back.
